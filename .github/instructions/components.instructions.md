# Writing code for components

## Coding principles to use
- SOLID principles are a must when writing code
- use KISS principles for readability
- use DRY principles for keeping code reusable

## Styling
- use tailwind css for each component
- make each component responsive
- form small components (i.e buttons) use motion/framer-motion for animations
- all components and pages should be consistent with the theme.
